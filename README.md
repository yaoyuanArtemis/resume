# typst-cv-miku

This is a simple, elegant, academic style CV template for [typst](https://typst.app/). Support for English and Chinese (and more).

You can see the online demo [here](https://typst.app/project/rbxGsQC-tEkDq0mnNIuxkv).


## Usage

1. Read [typst](https://typst.app/docs/) documentation to know about Typst.
2. Modify these files to build your personal resume and you can edit any code to reach what you want if you have capability.
3. Modify `.typ` files to fit your needs. You may need to learn some basic typst syntax.

## By the waygit 

Typst currently has some [bugs](https://github.com/typst/typst/issues/144) in the emoji output, so for the time being SVG images are being used instead, which you can find at [twemoji utils](https://twemoji.godi.se/).
